# Brain-Tumor-Detection
A convolutional neural network model built with Tensorflow & Keras to detect brain tumor and its different variants.
Data of the MRI images were found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)

#### Data:
The dataset has been divided into 2 categories Testing and Training each of them containing 4 different variants of brain tumor and each variant has 100 - 74 images.
